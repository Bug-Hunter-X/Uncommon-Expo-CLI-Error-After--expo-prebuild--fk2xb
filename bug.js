While building an Expo project, I encountered an unusual error related to the Expo CLI. After running `expo prebuild`, I received an error that was not immediately clear. The error message was vague and didn't directly point to the issue's root cause.  This problem occurs intermittently, making it difficult to reproduce consistently. The error message might mention issues with dependencies or native modules, but the exact details change each time.
